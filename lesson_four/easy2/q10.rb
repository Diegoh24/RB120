=begin
-reduces dependencies, lower maintanence, less probablity of one bug crashing the whole program,
  -also means it is easier to debug
-allows programmer hide certain data and instances from other parts of the program via encapsulation.
-allows programmer to think on a more abstact level.

-the code will technically run slower, but the tradeoff is it is also more readable, and cleaner in general.

=begin
1. Creating objects allows programmers to think more abstractly about the code
2. Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize
3. it allows us only to expose functionality to the parts of the code that need it,
meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.
4. Allows you to easily give functionality to different parts of the application withouth duplication
5. Can build applications faster as you can use pre-written code
6. As software becomes more complex, the complexity can be managed.
